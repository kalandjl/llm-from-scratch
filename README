## Description
In this project I will be creating an LLM from scratch, without the aid of libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. Taking on such a challenges is important to my personal development as it allows me to understand LLM's in a practical, encompassing manner, in all of it's complexity which modern libraries often take away.
